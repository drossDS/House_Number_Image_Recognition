# House Number Image Recognition
Employing Neural Networks to Recognize Digits

## Background and Problem Statement
The Street View Housing Numbers (SVHN) dataset contains over 600,000 images of house numbers captured from Google Street View Images.  Each image is 32 x 32 pixels and is identified as the correct digit.  The data provided for this project were gray-scale images dervied from the SVHN dataset, pared back to only 60,000 images in total (presumaly to make this much less computationally intensive).  The goal of this project was to create a model which could identify the images from this dataset as their correct digit.  To do this, both artificial and convolutional neural networks (ANN and CNN) algorithms were employed.
